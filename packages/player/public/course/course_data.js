Then, we’ll dig into what sexual harassment is, how you can prevent it, and what you can do to combat inappropriate behavior as both an employee and a manager.\n\nWhile this course is designed to comply with the most state regulations for sexual harassment prevention training, please reference the regulations that apply to your company to ensure compliance. Many states require a live Q&A and feedback mechanism, so you may need to supplement this Rise course with those elements to comply with regulations in your state.",

We might get caught up in our day-to-day operations and unintentionally disregard others. We might focus too intently on what we want, and forget to consider how our words and actions impact others. So, how can we combat those roadblocks and build a respectful workplace?\n\nIn this section, you’ll learn the definition of respect and how it means different things to different people.

        body: "# Respect Is in the Eye of the Beholder\n\nRespect is about treating others with dignity, but that conduct can take on multiple interpretations. Depending on who you ask, the same actions or words can hold vastly different meanings. Consider something as simple as “hello.” For some, a firm handshake is a sign of respect, while for others, that physical contact may be an uncomfortable invasion of personal space.\n\nRespect is in the eye of the beholder. A person’s perceptions, background, and personal feelings will influence how they define respect. And, the more diverse our workplace, the higher the likelihood that we’ll have varied interpretations of what’s respectful.  \n\nTreating others how we want to be treated isn’t enough. Genuine respect requires looking outside ourselves and recognizing the needs and values of others. It means treating others the way they would like to be treated, rather than how we want to be treated.",

That cultivates a culture of understanding, which leads to a healthy exchange of knowledge and information.\n\n2. **Strong workplace relationships:** With respect comes acceptance and understanding, and that, in turn, strengthens workplace relationships.

Rather than hiding aspects of their backgrounds or personalities, people can come to work as they are, without fear. That allows them to focus their energy on what’s important—their work—instead of worrying about concealing their true selves.\n\n4. **Heightened engagement and productivity:** Respected employees are more likely to feel a part of the workplace culture. They have a sense of belonging, which leads to increased engagement, lower absenteeism, a willingness to take on more responsibility, and a drive to be productive.\n\n5. **Increased job satisfaction:** Respect has an enormous impact on an employee’s overall sense of well-being. A simple act of respect can inspire someone’s confidence, lift their spirits, and encourage them to do their best work. Even in times of looming deadlines and long hours, respected employees feel valued and appreciated—and that brings a sense of pride that fosters high performance.",

Harassment is unwelcome conduct based on a protected characteristic that makes a person feel uncomfortable enough that it alters their work conditions or creates a hostile, threatening, or offensive work environment. Similar to discrimination, harassment also becomes unlawful when it is based on a legally protected characteristic. For example, harassment describes when a person makes a racial slur, a sexist joke, or shares cartoons displaying negative stereotypes about people who practice a certain religion at work. \n\nWhile employers are legally responsible for creating a workplace that’s free from harassment and discrimination, everyone needs to make a conscious effort to ensure their own words, actions, and decisions treat others fairly and respectfully.",

Under the ADA, a disability is defined as any long-term physical, mental, or sensory impairment. These impairments can include hearing or vision issues, mental health disabilities, or reliance on mobility aids such as wheelchairs, canes, or walkers.\n\nUnder the ADA, it’s illegal to deny benefits, make hiring decisions, or calculate someone’s pay based on a disability. So long as a person can perform the essential functions of the job, the disability may not play a role in any employment decisions.\n\nThe ADA also specifies that disabled individuals may request “reasonable accommodations” to help them perform their job. As long as that accommodation doesn’t cause undue hardship to the business (such as an excessive financial burden), employers must agree to meet that request.",
